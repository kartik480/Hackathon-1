## ⚠️ Important Notes

### ✅ What Will Work:
- ✅ All pages and navigation
- ✅ All styling and design
- ✅ All JavaScript functionality (cart, wishlist, search, filters)
- ✅ Product images (loaded from Unsplash - needs internet)
- ✅ Google Fonts (loaded from CDN - needs internet)
- ✅ All animations and effects

### ⚠️ What Won't Transfer:
- ❌ Cart/Wishlist data (stored in browser localStorage - will be empty for your friend)
- ❌ Browser history/cache (expected behavior)

### 🌐 Internet Connection Required For:
- Product images (Unsplash)
- Google Fonts (Inter font family)
- If no internet: Images won't load, but website structure will work

## 🔍 Troubleshooting for Your Friend

### If website looks broken:
1. **Check folder structure** - Make sure `css/` and `js/` folders exist
2. **Check file names** - Must be exact (case-sensitive on Mac/Linux):
   - `css/styles.css` (not `Styles.css`)
   - `js/script.js` (not `Script.js`)
3. **Try different browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Edge
4. **Check internet connection** - Needed for images and fonts

### If images don't show:
- Check internet connection
- Images load from Unsplash (external service)
- Website will still work, just without images

### If fonts look different:
- Check internet connection
- Fonts load from Google Fonts
- Browser will use fallback fonts if offline
